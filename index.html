				What is Disney’s art style?
			</h2>
			
			<p>
				Disney animation has a ‘storybook realism’ art style: a naturalistic and realistic style inspired by the aesthetic of classic
				<br>European storybook illustration. This artistic style started developing when Walt Disney was working on his first
				feature-length <br>animation (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs).

			<p>
				There are, of course, many differences between individual Disney animation movies.<br>
				But if we look at the classic fairy tales – which are generally associated with the characteristic Disney aesthetic – their
				<br>art style can often be traced back to the first Disney feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
			</p> 
			
			<p>
				The style of Snow White was inspired by the European style of storybook art.
				
				Disney’s version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs opens with a storybook and the storybook <br>actually sets the tone for the general look and feel of the movie.
				
				To create the feeling of a ‘living storybook’, Disney had help from several great stylists of European storybook illustration
				<br>(e.g. Gustaf Tenggren, Albert Hurter, Ferdinand Horvath). These European artists helped Disney to develop a style that
				would <br>be familiar and beloved with the audiences.
			</p> 
			
			<p>
				The storybook became a sort of style guide for the artists working on the animated classic. The artists instilled the
				<br>European storybook feel in all of the little details of the animated feature. For instance in the intricate wood
				<br>carvings, in the design of the wooden cottage of the seven dwarfs, and even in the way the trees were drawn and painted
				<br>in the forest.
				
				And, eventually, this storybook aesthetic set the standard for the rest of Disney’s animated productions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Example: For the making of Tangled (2010) the creators used Disney’s Cinderella (1950) and Pinocchio (1940) as inspiration to
				<br> create a style guide for the environments in Tangled. This shows how the individual styles of Disney animation movies
				can be <br> related to Disney’s classics.

					A sense of realism and naturalism
				</h2>
				<img src="image/concept_art.jpg" alt="Bambi forest" width="450">
				<p>
					Walt Disney understood from the very beginning that for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to succeed, the audience needed a
					<br> strong emotional connection to the film and its characters. He intended to establish this emotional connection by 
					<br>creating a sense of realism and naturalism in his animated feature.  
				</p>

				<p>
					A few examples of how Disney created a natural and realistic style in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs:
				</p>
				<img src="image/pumpkin.jpg" alt="Pumpkin carriage in Cinderella" width="450">
				<p>
					<span><a href="#animation">Animation.</a></span> Walt Disney had his animators attend life drawing classes to develop their drawing and animation skills. In <br> their extensive training they learned how to create natural and life-like movement in animation. Disney also hired actors <br> to create live-action sequences of scenes that had to be animated. The footage was rotoscoped or used as a reference <br> guide for the animators to work from. These practices resulted in a much more realistic animation style. 
				</p>
				<img src="image/design.png" alt="Cat from Aristocats" width="450">	
				<p>
					<span><a href="#design">Character designs.</a></span> The characters were designed more realistically and believably than ever before in animation. At the <br>beginning of the character design process the characters looked very cartoonish, but these early designs would eventually<br> be refined as the artists grew more used to the European illustrative look. 
				</p>
				<img src="image/background.jpg" alt="Castle" width="450">
				<p>
					<span><a href="#background">Environment and backgrounds.</a></span> The fairy tale world was designed and created to feel ‘real’ to the audience. The <br>backgrounds, trees, and animals were all drawn and painted in a (relatively) realistic manner so that they all added to <br>the sense of realism in the story.
				</p> 
				<img src="image/background2.jpg" alt="House from Winnie the Pooh" width="450">
				<p>
					<span><a href="#technique">Film techniques.</a></span> Disney used camera movements and techniques in their animated features that were commonly used for <br>live-action films. A new camera system, the multi-plane camera, was invented at the Disney animation studios to better <br>reveal the depth and dimension of the drawings.
				</p> 
				<img src="image/music.jpg" alt="Music band from Princess and a frog" width="450">
				<p>
					<span><a href="#sound">Sound effects.</a></span> Realistic sound effects were created so that the animated world of Snow White sounded like a real world. <br>Adding believable sounds to the animation brought the story even further to life.

				Conclusion
			</h2>
			<img src="image/concept.jpg" alt="Elsa and the spirit of water" width="450">
			<p>
				Throughout the years traditional (2D) animation at Disney has gradually been replaced with 3D animation, but the most basic <br> look of a Disney fairy tale is still (European) storybook illustration with a realistic and naturalistic approach. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In a 1935 memo, Walt Disney wrote: “… our study of the actual is not so that we may accomplish the actual, but so that we may <br> have a basis upon which to go into the fantastic, the unreal, the imaginative – and yet to let it have a foundation of fact, <br> in order that it may more richly possess sincerity and contact with the public.” 
			</p>

			<p>
				I think this quote by Disney explains the essence of his approach to art (and perhaps it also explains the essence of all art <br> in general). Disney answers the question of why artists should study drawing from life and why the imagined should always be <br> informed by the real (or, the ‘actual’). 
			</p>

			<p>
				So, if you want to learn Disney’s art style (or any other art style there is), a very good place to start is drawing from <br>real life. Practice drawing both inanimate objects (still-life) and animate objects (figure drawing and gesture drawing) from <br> real life references.
